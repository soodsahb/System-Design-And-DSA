What is Strategy Design Pattern?

The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them, and make them interchangeable.

Instead of hard-coding behavior inside a class, the behavior is extracted into separate strategy classes. The context object delegates the work to a strategy object, making the algorithm easy to change at runtime.

Why use Strategy Pattern?

Eliminates large if-else or switch statements

Follows Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification)

Improves code readability and maintainability

Allows changing behavior without modifying the context class

How it works (Conceptually)

A Strategy Interface defines a common method for all algorithms

Multiple Concrete Strategy classes implement this interface

A Context class holds a reference to a strategy and delegates execution to it

The strategy can be changed dynamically at runtime


When to use Strategy Pattern?

When you have multiple ways to perform a task

When behavior needs to change dynamically

When conditional logic is becoming complex and hard to manage
