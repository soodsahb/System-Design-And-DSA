Adapter Pattern

Definition
Adapter is a structural design pattern that lets classes with incompatible interfaces work together by wrapping one interface with another.

Intent
- Convert the interface of an existing class into the interface the client expects.
- Reuse existing or third-party code without modifying its source.

Key Participants
- Client: Uses the target interface.
- Target: The interface expected by the client.
- Adaptee: Existing class with an incompatible interface.
- Adapter: Translates calls from Target to Adaptee.

When to Use
- A useful class exists, but its interface does not match your needs.
- You want to integrate legacy systems with minimal changes.

Benefits
- Improves reuse of existing components.
- Keeps client code stable while integrating different APIs.

Trade-offs
- Adds an extra layer and slight complexity.
- Too many adapters can make architecture harder to trace.

Real-World Example
A travel plug adapter converts one plug type to another so a device can work in a different socket standard.
