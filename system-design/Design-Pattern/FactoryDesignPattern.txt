Factory Design Pattern
What is Factory Design Pattern?

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses or a factory class decide which object to instantiate.

In simple words:
👉 Object creation logic is centralized, and the client does not need to know the exact class being created.

Why use Factory Pattern?

Hides object creation complexity

Removes tight coupling between client and concrete classes

Makes code scalable and maintainable

Follows Single Responsibility Principle and Open/Closed Principle
