Factory Pattern

Definition
Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects while allowing subclasses or factory logic to decide which concrete type to instantiate.

Intent
- Centralize object creation logic.
- Hide concrete class selection from client code.

Key Participants
- Product: Common interface for created objects.
- Concrete Products: Specific implementations.
- Factory: Creates and returns Product objects.
- Client: Uses Product without knowing concrete class details.

When to Use
- Object creation logic is complex or frequently changes.
- You want to reduce direct dependency on concrete classes.

Benefits
- Improves maintainability by isolating creation logic.
- Supports Open/Closed Principle for adding new product types.

Trade-offs
- Adds abstraction and extra classes.
- Simple systems may not need this level of structure.

Real-World Example
A document generator selects PDF, Word, or HTML generator based on requested output type.
