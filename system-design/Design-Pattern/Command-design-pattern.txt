Command Pattern

Definition
Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a standalone object containing all details needed to perform the action.

Intent
- Decouple the object that sends a request from the object that executes it.
- Support features like queueing, logging, retry, and undo.

Key Participants
- Command: Declares the execution operation.
- Concrete Command: Implements execution by calling a receiver.
- Receiver: Knows how to perform the actual work.
- Invoker: Triggers command execution.
- Client: Creates and configures command objects.

When to Use
- You need to parameterize actions as objects.
- You need undo/redo or command history.
- Requests must be queued or executed later.

Benefits
- Reduces coupling between request sender and handler.
- Makes adding new commands easy.

Trade-offs
- Increases number of classes/objects.
- Can feel heavy for very simple workflows.

Real-World Example
A restaurant order ticket captures what to do, and the kitchen executes it later.
