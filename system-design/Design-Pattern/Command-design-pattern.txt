The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object. This helps decouple the sender of a request from the object that actually performs the action.

Main components:

Command Interface – defines the execute() method

Concrete Command – implements the command and calls the receiver

Receiver – performs the actual work

Invoker – triggers the command

This pattern makes it easy to support undo/redo, logging, and queuing of actions.
