Singleton Design Pattern, a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.

This pattern is commonly used for shared resources such as configuration managers, logging services, and database connections, where a single instance is required across the application.

A simple yet powerful concept that helps maintain controlled access, consistency, and resource efficiency in system design.
