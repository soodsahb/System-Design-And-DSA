Singleton Pattern

Definition
Singleton is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has exactly one instance and provides a global access point to that instance.

Intent
- Control access to a shared resource through one managed instance.

Key Characteristics
- Single instance throughout application lifecycle.
- Centralized, global access point.
- Usually includes lazy or eager initialization.

When to Use
- Exactly one shared object is required, such as app configuration, logger, or cache manager.

Benefits
- Prevents inconsistent state from multiple competing instances.
- Reduces overhead for expensive shared resources.

Trade-offs
- Global state can make testing and debugging harder.
- Can hide dependencies and increase coupling if overused.

Real-World Example
A central configuration manager loaded once and read by all modules.
