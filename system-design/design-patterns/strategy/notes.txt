Strategy Pattern

Definition
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

Intent
- Separate varying behavior from the context that uses it.
- Replace conditional-heavy logic with pluggable strategies.

Key Participants
- Strategy: Common interface for algorithms.
- Concrete Strategies: Different algorithm implementations.
- Context: Holds a strategy and delegates behavior to it.

When to Use
- Multiple ways exist to perform the same task.
- Behavior should change dynamically based on runtime conditions.

Benefits
- Removes large if/else or switch blocks.
- Encourages composition over inheritance.
- Improves testability of individual algorithms.

Trade-offs
- Increases number of classes.
- Client or configuration must choose the correct strategy.

Real-World Example
A navigation app switching route calculation based on mode: fastest, shortest, or toll-free.
