Observer Pattern

Definition
Observer is a behavioral design pattern where one object (subject) maintains a list of dependents (observers) and notifies them automatically when its state changes.

Intent
- Build one-to-many dependency between objects.
- Keep related components synchronized without tight coupling.

Key Participants
- Subject: Stores state and manages observer registration.
- Observer: Defines update behavior.
- Concrete Subject: Sends notifications when state changes.
- Concrete Observer: Reacts to updates.

When to Use
- A change in one object should update multiple objects.
- You need event-driven communication between components.

Benefits
- Decouples publishers from subscribers.
- Supports dynamic subscription and unsubscription.
- Useful for event systems and UI updates.

Trade-offs
- Notification chains can be hard to trace in large systems.
- Poor lifecycle management can cause memory leaks.

Real-World Example
A news channel notifies all subscribers whenever a new article is published.
