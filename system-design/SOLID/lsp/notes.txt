3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Definition:
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without altering the correctness of the program.

❌ Violation
class Bird {
  fly() {}
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
  fly() {
    throw new Error("Ostrich can't fly");
  }
}

✅ Correct
class Bird {}

class FlyingBird extends Bird {
  fly() {}
}

class Sparrow extends FlyingBird {}
